The interview took place around the time Crazy Dave was volunteering with students in the KSU computer science department for a web development project. Not only were the editors impressed with Dave's part in working with students design a website for Crazy Dave's Hair Studio at KSU, they were equally impressed with his community activism and his unique talent on the unicycle. Dave is very proud to contribute to student's success at KSU and encourages them take part in community activism to promote the well being of their surrounding area. The project Dave is working on with Computer Science students will allow the students real life experience in designing websites for organizations.</p><!-- image here --><h2>MDJ interviews Dave</h2><img src="../images/latestnews_03.jpg" width="95" height="115" alt="favorite album" align = "right"/> <p>This week the Marietta Daily Journal conducted an interview with Dave.
